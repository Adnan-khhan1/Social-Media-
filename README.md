# DecentralSocial

## Project Vision

To create a truly decentralized social media platform where users have complete ownership of their data, content, and social connections without relying on centralized authorities or corporations that can censor, manipulate, or monetize user information without consent.

## Project Description

DecentralSocial is a blockchain-based social media platform built on Ethereum that empowers users to interact, share content, and build communities in a transparent and censorship-resistant environment. The platform eliminates intermediaries by storing all user profiles, posts, and social interactions directly on the blockchain, ensuring permanent data ownership and freedom of expression.

The smart contract serves as the backbone of the platform, handling user registration, content creation, social interactions (likes and follows), and maintaining the integrity of all social data through immutable blockchain technology.

## Key Features

### üîê **User Profile Management**
- Create unique user profiles with customizable usernames and bios
- Decentralized identity system with no central authority required
- Profile data permanently stored on blockchain

### üìù **Content Creation & Sharing**
- Create posts with content validation (up to 500 characters)
- Immutable content storage ensuring posts cannot be altered or deleted by third parties
- Timestamped posts with cryptographic proof of creation

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **Social Interactions**
- Like and unlike posts with transparent vote counting
- Prevention of self-liking to maintain authentic engagement
- Real-time like counters visible to all users

### üë• **Social Networking**
- Follow and unfollow other users to build your social network
- Automatic follower/following count tracking
- Transparent follow relationships visible on-chain

### üìä **Data Transparency**
- View detailed user profiles including post count and social statistics
- Access complete post history for any user
- Check interaction status (likes, follows) between any users

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Validation**
- Comprehensive input validation to prevent spam and abuse
- Modifier-based access control ensuring only profile owners can post
- Prevention of duplicate profiles and self-interactions

## Technical Specifications

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum Compatible (Solidity ^0.8.19)
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient data structures and minimal storage operations
- **Events**: Comprehensive event emission for frontend integration
- **Security**: Input validation and access control modifiers

## Smart Contract Functions

1. **createProfile()** - Register new user with username and bio
2. **createPost()** - Publish new content to the platform  
3. **toggleLike()** - Like or unlike posts from other users
4. **followUser()** - Follow another user to see their content
5. **unfollowUser()** - Unfollow a user to stop seeing their content

## Future Scope

### üöÄ **Short Term (3-6 months)**
- **Comment System**: Add threaded comments on posts with reply functionality
- **Media Support**: Integration with IPFS for images, videos, and file sharing
- **Content Moderation**: Community-driven reporting and governance system
- **Mobile App**: React Native mobile application for iOS and Android

### üéØ **Medium Term (6-12 months)**
- **Token Economics**: Native token for platform governance and creator rewards
- **NFT Integration**: Mint posts as NFTs and create collectible content
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Deploy on multiple blockchains (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain)
- **Advanced Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs for private messaging and selective visibility

### üîÆ **Long Term (1-2 years)**
- **Decentralized Governance**: Full DAO implementation for platform decisions
- **Layer 2 Integration**: Optimized for Layer 2 solutions to reduce gas costs
- **AI Content Filtering**: Decentralized AI systems for spam and harmful content detection
- **Monetization Tools**: Creator subscription models and tip systems
- **Interoperability**: Cross-platform posting to traditional social media
- **Social Graph Analytics**: Advanced insights and recommendation algorithms

### üåê **Advanced Features**
- **Decentralized Storage**: Transition from IPFS to fully decentralized storage solutions
- **Identity Verification**: Decentralized identity verification without compromising privacy
- **Social Token Marketplace**: Users can create and trade their own social tokens
- **Metaverse Integration**: 3D social spaces and virtual reality interactions
- **DeFi Integration**: Social lending, crowdfunding, and community investment features

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contract to Ethereum or compatible network
2. Interact with the contract using Web3 tools or build a custom frontend
3. Create your profile and start posting to the decentralized social network
4. Connect with other users and build your decentralized social presence
